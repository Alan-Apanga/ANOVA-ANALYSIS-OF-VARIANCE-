Solved by SPSS

Vente-privee.com organizes exclusive sales events for international de-signer brands lasting from 2 to 4 days offering 50% to 70% discounts ex-clusively to its 9.5 million members. In 2008, vente-privee.com successfully launched its new online appearance for the UK.
The company decided to consult a market research firm to explore the cus-tomers’ buying behavior and their perception of the website.
In a small-scale ad hoc study, the firm gathered data from a sample of 30 randomly selected customers on the following variables:
 Identification number (id)
 Respondent’s gender (gender)
 Perceived image of vente-privee.com (image)
 Perceived ease-of-use of vente-privee.com (ease)
 Sales per respondent per year in GBP (sales)
The market research firm wants to identify potential areas of improvement for the website. The firm wanted to answer the following research ques-tions:
 Does the website’s perceived ease-of-use influence the customers’ buying behavior?
 Does the customers buying behavior depend on the interaction be-tween perceived ease-of-use and gender?
Answer both research questions by using an ANOVA for the second re-search question. Thereby, discuss results on…
1) The ANOVA assumptions.
2) The results of the Overall Tests.
3) The results of the post-hoc tests.
